This version was updated by Yu Tian and Johannes Abele, building on the [previous version](docs/Clearinghouse_Μethodology_Note_v1.pdf) of the methodological note by Julia Schmidt, Junya Ino, Yu Tian, Guglielmo Zappalà and Lorenz Noe. 

Prior to this methodological note, the [Clearinghouse Data Sourcing Strategy](docs/Data_Sourcing_Strategy_CH_2021.pdf) was published in early 2021 to inform the Bern Network core group members of the latest developments in relation to the technical development of the Clearinghouse, in particular the proposed way forward for the data sourcing for the platform.
